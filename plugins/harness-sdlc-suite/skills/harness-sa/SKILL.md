# Solution Architecture Domain Skill

> **Domain-specific.** This skill provides the HOW for solution architecture projects. The harness provides the WHEN (orchestration, sprint contracts, feature ledger). This skill provides the HOW (framework selection, development methodology, deliverable verification, evaluation criteria anchors, and solution design patterns).

Activated when `domain_profile: solution_architecture` is declared in `.harness/spec.md`.

## Scope of This Skill

This skill covers the Solution Architecture lifecycle for a single solution:
- **Context**: Business drivers, constraints, stakeholders, quality attributes
- **Design**: Component decomposition, API contracts, data models, integration patterns
- **Validation**: Design reviews, proof of concept, capacity modeling, failure mode analysis
- **Communication**: Architecture diagrams, decision records, technical specifications

This skill is distinct from `harness-ea` (Enterprise Architecture). EA covers enterprise-wide capability mapping, portfolio management, and governance frameworks (TOGAF, Zachman). SA focuses on a single solution's technical design — how components fit together, how APIs are defined, how data flows, and how the solution meets non-functional requirements.

It is framework-agnostic at its core — any of the supported approaches can be selected. The C4 Model is the default because it provides progressive detail levels (Context, Container, Component, Code) that map naturally to harness sprints.


## Activation Check

This skill activates when `domain_profile: solution_architecture` is set in `.harness/spec.md` or `.harness/state.json`.

Before using this skill's procedures:
1. Verify the project produces solution design deliverables (HLDs, LLDs, API specs, data models — not enterprise-wide capability maps)
2. Read spec.md -> identify the selected SA framework (C4, Arc42, 4+1, etc.)
3. If no framework specified -> default to C4 Model
4. Check if `solution-architecture/` directory exists -> if yes, verify against the Repository Structure (Section 9)
5. Identify the architecture style -> select appropriate patterns from Section 7

---

## Section 1: SA Methodology

Select based on project characteristics during `/harness:start`:

| Framework | When to Use | Phase Structure | Harness Mapping |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| C4 Model | Most solution designs, progressive detail | Context, Container, Component, Code | 1 sprint = 1 C4 level |
| Arc42 | Documentation-heavy, European standard | 12 sections (constraints, context, building blocks, runtime, deployment, etc.) | 1 sprint = 2-3 Arc42 sections |
| 4+1 View | Complex systems, multiple stakeholder perspectives | Logical, Development, Process, Physical + Scenarios | 1 sprint = 1 view |
| Domain-Driven Design | Complex business domains, bounded contexts | Strategic design (contexts, maps) -> Tactical design (aggregates, entities, services) | 1 sprint = 1 bounded context |
| Microservices Patterns | Distributed systems, cloud-native | Decomposition, Communication, Data, Deployment, Observability | 1 sprint = 1 pattern category |

**Default:** C4 Model (if not specified by user).

The planner writes the selected framework into `spec.md` during initialization. The coordinator uses the mapping to structure sprint boundaries accordingly.

---

## Section 2: Solution Architecture Development Methodology

Select based on project type and stakeholder needs:

| Methodology | When to Use | How It Drives the Generator |
|-------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| API-First | Integration-heavy, multi-team | Generator defines API contracts FIRST (OpenAPI/AsyncAPI specs), then designs components around them |
| Component-First | Monolith decomposition, modularization | Generator identifies components and boundaries FIRST, then defines interfaces between them |
| Data-First | Data-intensive applications, analytics | Generator designs data models FIRST (conceptual, logical, physical), then builds services around data flows |
| Event-First | Event-driven, real-time, CQRS | Generator defines domain events and event flows FIRST, then designs producers, consumers, and projections |
| Contract-First | Multi-team, external integrations | Generator writes interface contracts FIRST (API specs, message schemas, SLAs), then implements behind contracts |

**Default:** API-First for all SA projects (if not specified).

### How Methodology Drives the Harness

The chosen methodology affects every phase:

1. **Generator behavior**: What to produce first (API specs? component diagrams? data models?)
2. **Evaluator criteria**: What to prioritize (API consistency? component cohesion? data integrity?)
3. **Sprint contract**: What acceptance criteria to define (API completeness? component boundaries? data model correctness?)
4. **Artifact types**: What deliverables per sprint (OpenAPI specs? C4 diagrams? ERDs?)

### Generator First-Action Table

| Methodology | Generator produces first | Then |
|-------------|------------------------|------|
| API-First | OpenAPI/AsyncAPI specifications with request/response schemas | Component design implementing the API contracts, data models supporting the APIs |
| Component-First | Component diagram with responsibilities and boundaries | Interface definitions between components, deployment mapping |
| Data-First | Conceptual and logical data models with entity relationships | Services that own data entities, API contracts for data access |
| Event-First | Domain event catalog with schemas and flow diagrams | Event producers, consumers, projections, and saga orchestration |
| Contract-First | Interface contracts (API specs, message schemas, SLAs) | Implementation design behind each contract, testing strategy |

---

## Section 3: Verification Strategy (SA Equivalent of Testing)

| Verification Type | SA Equivalent | Method |
|-------------------|--------------|--------|
| Unit test | Component design review | Each component has clear responsibility, defined interfaces, and no circular dependencies |
| Integration test | Interface consistency | API contracts between components are compatible (request/response schemas match, error codes consistent) |
| E2E test | Scenario walkthrough | User scenario traces through all components from entry point to data store without gaps |
| Smoke test | Deliverable completeness | Required design documents exist and are non-empty |
| Regression | Pattern compliance | Architecture patterns consistently applied (e.g., all services use the same auth pattern, all APIs follow the same versioning scheme) |

### Design Completeness Checks

- Does the system context diagram show all external systems and actors?
- Are all components defined with clear responsibilities?
- Does each API endpoint have a complete specification (request, response, errors, auth)?
- Are all data entities defined with relationships and ownership?
- Do non-functional requirements have measurable targets and design strategies?
- Are all integration points documented with protocols and data formats?
- Do architecture decision records exist for significant choices?

---

## Section 4: Deliverable Verification (Equivalent of Build/Runtime)

Since SA produces design documents, not running software, "build verification" means:

| Check | What to Verify | How |
|-------|---------------|-----|
| Document structure | Required sections present per framework | Check against C4/Arc42/4+1 section requirements |
| API specification | OpenAPI/AsyncAPI specs are valid | Lint specs with spectral or swagger-cli |
| Data model consistency | Entities referenced in APIs exist in data model | Cross-reference API schemas with data dictionary |
| Component boundaries | No circular dependencies between components | Trace dependency graph for cycles |
| NFR coverage | Each NFR has a design strategy | Cross-reference NFR list with architecture decisions |
| Integration completeness | All external systems have documented integration patterns | Cross-reference context diagram with integration specs |
| Decision records | All significant decisions documented | Verify ADR exists for each technology choice and pattern selection |

### C4 Level Gate Checks

| C4 Level | Required Deliverables |
|----------|----------------------|
| Context | System context diagram, actors list, external systems list, system purpose |
| Container | Container diagram, technology choices, container responsibilities, communication protocols |
| Component | Component diagram per container, component responsibilities, interface definitions |
| Code (optional) | Class/module diagrams for complex components, key algorithms documented |

### Arc42 Section Gate Checks

| Section | Required Content |
|---------|-----------------|
| 1. Requirements | Quality goals, stakeholders, top 3-5 requirements |
| 2. Constraints | Technical, organizational, and regulatory constraints |
| 3. Context | System context with external interfaces |
| 4. Solution Strategy | Key design decisions and technology choices |
| 5. Building Blocks | Level 1-3 decomposition with responsibilities |
| 6. Runtime | Key scenarios as sequence or activity diagrams |
| 7. Deployment | Infrastructure topology, node mapping |
| 8. Crosscutting | Security, logging, error handling, configuration |
| 9. Decisions | Architecture decision records |
| 10. Quality | Quality tree, quality scenarios |
| 11. Risks | Technical risks and debt |
| 12. Glossary | Domain terms and definitions |

| **Data Ownership Vacuum** | Data entities with no clear owning service or shared mutable state | design_coherence: -1 | Require explicit data ownership |

---

## Section 11: Domain-Driven Design Specifics

This section provides actionable DDD guidance for solution architects designing complex business domains. Use these templates during the Strategic Design and Tactical Design phases of a DDD-driven architecture.

### Strategic Design

Strategic design establishes the high-level structure of the domain by identifying bounded contexts and their relationships. Complete these steps before moving to tactical design.

#### Bounded Context Identification Checklist

Use this checklist when decomposing a domain into bounded contexts:

- [ ] Identify distinct sub-domains by analyzing business capabilities and organizational boundaries
- [ ] For each candidate context, verify it has its own ubiquitous language (same term has different meaning across contexts)
- [ ] Confirm each context can be developed and deployed independently
- [ ] Verify each context has a single team owner (or a clear ownership split rationale)
- [ ] Check that no entity spans multiple contexts without an explicit mapping strategy
- [ ] Document the context boundary with inputs, outputs, and invariants it protects
- [ ] Validate with domain experts that context boundaries align with real business divisions

#### Context Mapping Patterns

Use the following patterns to define relationships between bounded contexts. Each pattern describes a different integration strategy depending on team dynamics, power relationships, and coupling tolerance.

| Pattern | Description | When to Use | Team Dynamic |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Shared Kernel | Two contexts share a subset of the domain model; changes require agreement from both teams | Small, tightly collaborating teams working on overlapping functionality | Co-equal partnership, high trust |
| Customer-Supplier | Upstream context (supplier) provides data or services; downstream context (customer) depends on it | Clear producer-consumer relationship with negotiable interface | Upstream accommodates downstream needs |
| Conformist | Downstream context adopts the upstream model as-is without translation | Upstream team has no incentive or capacity to support downstream needs | Downstream adapts, no negotiation |
| Anti-Corruption Layer | Downstream context translates the upstream model into its own domain language through an isolation layer | Upstream model is legacy, unstable, or conceptually misaligned with downstream needs | Downstream protects itself from external model pollution |
| Open Host Service | Upstream context exposes a well-defined public API (protocol) that multiple consumers can use | Multiple downstream consumers with similar needs; upstream wants a single integration surface | Upstream publishes, many consume |
| Published Language | Contexts communicate through a shared, documented data format (schema, standard, or specification) | Cross-organization integration, industry standards (EDI, FHIR, FIX) | Format-driven, decoupled teams |
| Separate Ways | Contexts do not integrate at all; each solves the overlapping need independently | Cost of integration exceeds benefit; overlap is minor or temporary | No relationship, full independence |

#### Context Map Template

Document the full context map for a solution using this format:

```
Context Map: [Solution Name]

[Context A] <-> [Context B] : Shared Kernel
  - Shared elements: [list shared entities/value objects]
  - Governance: [who approves changes to the shared kernel]

[Context C] -> [Context D] : Customer-Supplier
  - Upstream (Supplier): Context C
  - Downstream (Customer): Context D
  - Contract: [API spec or event schema reference]

[Context E] -> [Context F] : Anti-Corruption Layer
  - ACL Location: Context F inbound adapter
  - Translation: [upstream model element] -> [downstream model element]
```

### Tactical Design

Tactical design defines the internal structure of each bounded context. Use these templates to design entities, value objects, and aggregates within a single context.

#### Entity vs Value Object Decision Table

| Criterion | Entity | Value Object |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Identity | Has a unique, persistent identity (ID) that distinguishes it even when all attributes are identical | Defined entirely by its attributes; two instances with the same values are interchangeable |
| Lifecycle | Created, modified, persisted, and eventually archived or deleted | Immutable once created; replaced rather than modified |
| Equality | Compared by identity (ID), not by attribute values | Compared by structural equality (all attribute values match) |
| Examples | Customer, Order, Account, Product (catalog item) | Money (amount + currency), Address, DateRange, EmailAddress, Coordinates |
| Persistence | Own table/document with a primary key | Embedded within an entity or stored as a composite column |
| Mutability | Attributes change over time; state transitions are meaningful | No state changes; create a new instance instead |

**Decision rule:** If the concept must be tracked over time and distinguished from other instances with the same attributes, it is an Entity. Otherwise, prefer a Value Object for simplicity and immutability.

#### Aggregate Design Rules

An aggregate is a cluster of entities and value objects with a single root entity that enforces invariants. Follow these rules when designing aggregates:

1. **Single responsibility for invariants**: Each aggregate protects one consistency boundary. If an invariant spans two aggregates, reconsider the boundary.
2. **Reference by identity**: Aggregates reference other aggregates by ID, not by direct object reference. This prevents transactional coupling.
3. **Small aggregates**: Prefer small aggregates (one root entity + value objects). Large aggregates cause contention and performance issues.
4. **Eventual consistency between aggregates**: Use domain events to synchronize state across aggregate boundaries. Only enforce immediate consistency within a single aggregate.
5. **Root entity is the sole entry point**: All external access goes through the aggregate root. Child entities and value objects are not directly accessible from outside.

| Aggregate Component | Role | Access Rule |
|--------------------|------|-------------|
| Aggregate Root (Entity) | Entry point; enforces all invariants; controls lifecycle of children | Directly accessible by repositories and application services |
| Child Entity | Exists only within the aggregate; has local identity (unique within the aggregate, not globally) | Accessed only through the aggregate root |
| Value Object | Describes attributes of the root or child entities; immutable | Accessed only through the aggregate root |

#### Domain Service vs Application Service

| Aspect | Domain Service | Application Service |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Purpose | Encapsulates domain logic that does not belong to a single entity or value object | Orchestrates use cases by coordinating domain objects, repositories, and infrastructure |
| Domain knowledge | Contains business rules and domain logic | Contains no business rules; delegates to domain layer |
| Dependencies | Other domain objects (entities, value objects, domain events) | Domain services, repositories, external service adapters |
| Example | PricingService.calculateDiscount(order, customer) | PlaceOrderUseCase.execute(command) -- coordinates Order aggregate, PricingService, PaymentGateway |
| Layer | Domain layer | Application layer |

### Ubiquitous Language Glossary

Maintain a glossary per bounded context to ensure all team members (developers, domain experts, product owners) use the same terms with the same meaning.

| Term | Definition | Bounded Context | Examples | Anti-Examples |
|------|-----------|----------------|----------|--------------|
| [Term] | [Precise definition as used within this context] | [Context name] | [Correct usage examples] | [Common misuses or confusions with terms from other contexts] |

**Glossary rules:**
- One entry per term per context. The same word in different contexts gets separate entries.
- Definitions must be validated by a domain expert, not invented by developers.
- Anti-examples column prevents drift by documenting how the term is misused or confused.
- Review the glossary at every sprint boundary; remove terms that are no longer used.

## Section 12: API Contract Templates

This section provides starter templates for API specifications. Use these when a sprint contract requires API design deliverables.

### OpenAPI 3.1 Starter Skeleton

The following is a minimal but complete OpenAPI 3.1 specification that a generator can copy and customize. It includes standard error responses, pagination, and a bearer auth security scheme.

### API Versioning Strategy

Choose a versioning approach based on the integration context. The table below compares the three common strategies.

| Strategy | Mechanism | When to Use | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| URL Path | `/v1/resources`, `/v2/resources` | Public APIs, consumer-facing services, APIs with infrequent breaking changes | Simple to understand, easy to route, clear in documentation and logs | URL pollution, harder to sunset old versions, clients must update URLs |
| Header | `Accept: application/vnd.api.v2+json` or custom `API-Version: 2` | Internal APIs, APIs where URL stability matters, content-negotiation-aware clients | Clean URLs, supports content negotiation, version hidden from casual inspection | Less discoverable, requires header-aware tooling, harder to test in browser |
| Query Parameter | `/resources?version=2` | Transitional versioning, quick experiments, APIs where header support is limited | Easy to add without URL changes, simple for testing | Caching complications (query string affects cache keys), less conventional |

**Recommended defaults:**
- **Public APIs**: URL path versioning (simplest for external consumers)
- **Internal service-to-service**: Header versioning (cleaner, service meshes handle headers well)
- **Experimental or transitional**: Query parameter (low-effort, easy to remove)

#### Deprecation Policy Template

| Element | Policy |
|---------|--------|
| Deprecation notice period | Minimum [N] months before removal |
| Communication channel | Changelog entry, `Sunset` HTTP header on deprecated endpoints, API portal banner |
| Sunset header format | `Sunset: Sat, 01 Jan 2028 00:00:00 GMT` (RFC 7231 date) |
| Migration guide | Published before deprecation notice; includes before/after examples |
| Monitoring | Track usage of deprecated endpoints; alert if usage exceeds threshold after sunset date |
| Removal criteria | Zero traffic for [N] consecutive days after sunset date, or explicit stakeholder sign-off |

#### Breaking vs Non-Breaking Change Classification

| Change Type | Classification | Action Required |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| Add optional field to response | Non-breaking | No version bump; document in changelog |
| Add optional query parameter | Non-breaking | No version bump; document in changelog |
| Add new endpoint | Non-breaking | No version bump; document in changelog |
| Remove field from response | Breaking | New version required |
| Rename field | Breaking | New version required |
| Change field type | Breaking | New version required |
| Add required field to request | Breaking | New version required |
| Change URL structure | Breaking | New version required |
| Change authentication method | Breaking | New version required |
| Change error response format | Breaking | New version required |

## Section 13: Threat Modeling

This section provides a structured approach to identifying and prioritizing security threats during solution architecture design. Use these templates when a sprint contract requires threat analysis deliverables.

### STRIDE Analysis Template

STRIDE is a threat classification model developed at Microsoft. Each category represents a distinct class of security threat. Complete one row per identified threat.

| Threat Category | Description | Affected Component | Likelihood (1-5) | Impact (1-5) | Risk Score | Mitigation |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| **Spoofing** | Attacker impersonates a legitimate user, service, or system component | [Component name] | [1-5] | [1-5] | [L x I] | [Specific countermeasure] |
| **Tampering** | Attacker modifies data in transit, at rest, or in processing to alter system behavior | [Component name] | [1-5] | [1-5] | [L x I] | [Specific countermeasure] |
| **Repudiation** | Actor denies performing an action and the system cannot prove otherwise | [Component name] | [1-5] | [1-5] | [L x I] | [Specific countermeasure] |
| **Information Disclosure** | Sensitive data is exposed to unauthorized parties through leaks, logs, or side channels | [Component name] | [1-5] | [1-5] | [L x I] | [Specific countermeasure] |
| **Denial of Service** | Attacker degrades or prevents legitimate access to the system through resource exhaustion or abuse | [Component name] | [1-5] | [1-5] | [L x I] | [Specific countermeasure] |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Attacker gains higher access rights than authorized, bypassing access controls | [Component name] | [1-5] | [1-5] | [L x I] | [Specific countermeasure] |

**How to use this template:**
1. Draw or reference the system's data flow diagram (DFD) showing trust boundaries
2. For each component that crosses a trust boundary, enumerate threats in each STRIDE category
3. Score likelihood and impact independently, then calculate the risk score
4. Prioritize mitigations by risk score (highest first)
5. Record mitigations as architecture decisions (ADRs) or backlog items

### Risk Scoring Matrix

Risk Score = Likelihood x Impact. Use this matrix to classify threats.

| | Impact 1 (Negligible) | Impact 2 (Minor) | Impact 3 (Moderate) | Impact 4 (Major) | Impact 5 (Severe) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Likelihood 5 (Almost Certain)** | 5 - Medium | 10 - High | 15 - Critical | 20 - Critical | 25 - Critical |
| **Likelihood 4 (Likely)** | 4 - Low | 8 - Medium | 12 - High | 16 - Critical | 20 - Critical |
| **Likelihood 3 (Possible)** | 3 - Low | 6 - Medium | 9 - High | 12 - High | 15 - Critical |
| **Likelihood 2 (Unlikely)** | 2 - Low | 4 - Low | 6 - Medium | 8 - Medium | 10 - High |
| **Likelihood 1 (Rare)** | 1 - Low | 2 - Low | 3 - Low | 4 - Low | 5 - Medium |

#### Risk Classification Thresholds

| Classification | Score Range | Required Action |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| Critical | 15-25 | Must mitigate before deployment; architecture change required |
| High | 9-14 | Must mitigate before production release; document accepted residual risk |
| Medium | 5-8 | Should mitigate; acceptable to defer with documented rationale and timeline |
| Low | 1-4 | Monitor and review; mitigate opportunistically |

### Threat Matrix Summary Format

Use this summary table to present the overall threat landscape to stakeholders after completing the STRIDE analysis.

| Component | Spoofing | Tampering | Repudiation | Info Disclosure | DoS | Elevation | Highest Risk |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-------------|----------------|-----|-----------|-------------|
| [Component A] | [Risk Score] | [Risk Score] | [Risk Score] | [Risk Score] | [Risk Score] | [Risk Score] | [Max Score] |
| [Component B] | [Risk Score] | [Risk Score] | [Risk Score] | [Risk Score] | [Risk Score] | [Risk Score] | [Max Score] |

## Section 14: Capacity Modeling Template

This section provides templates for estimating resource requirements and defining scaling thresholds. Use these when a sprint contract requires capacity planning deliverables.

### Resource Estimation Table

Estimate resource needs per component. Fill in current load from measurements; project peak load from traffic analysis or business growth assumptions.

| Component | Metric | Current Load | Peak Load | Growth Rate (monthly) | Target Capacity | Headroom |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-----------|----------------------|----------------|----------|
| [API Gateway] | Requests/sec | [measured] | [projected] | [%] | [provisioned] | [% above peak] |
| [Application Tier] | CPU cores | [measured] | [projected] | [%] | [provisioned] | [% above peak] |
| [Application Tier] | Memory (GB) | [measured] | [projected] | [%] | [provisioned] | [% above peak] |
| [Database] | Connections | [measured] | [projected] | [%] | [provisioned] | [% above peak] |
| [Database] | Storage (GB) | [measured] | [projected] | [%] | [provisioned] | [% above peak] |
| [Cache Layer] | Hit rate (%) | [measured] | [target] | N/A | [provisioned] | N/A |
| [Message Queue] | Messages/sec | [measured] | [projected] | [%] | [provisioned] | [% above peak] |
| [Network] | Bandwidth (Mbps) | [measured] | [projected] | [%] | [provisioned] | [% above peak] |

**Headroom guidance:** Maintain a minimum of 30% headroom above projected peak load. For databases and stateful services, maintain 50% headroom to accommodate growth between scaling events.

### Scaling Thresholds and Triggers

Define the thresholds at which scaling actions are triggered. Each threshold should have both a warning level (alert and prepare) and a critical level (act immediately).

| Resource | Metric | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold | Scaling Action | Cooldown Period |
|----------|--------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|
| [Compute] | CPU utilization | 60% sustained 5 min | 80% sustained 2 min | Add [N] instances (horizontal) | 5 minutes |
| [Compute] | Memory utilization | 70% sustained 5 min | 85% sustained 2 min | Add [N] instances (horizontal) | 5 minutes |
| [Database] | Connection pool usage | 70% of max | 90% of max | Increase pool size or add read replica | 15 minutes |
| [Database] | Storage usage | 75% of provisioned | 90% of provisioned | Expand storage volume | N/A (manual) |
| [Queue] | Queue depth | [N] messages pending | [N x 3] messages pending | Add [N] consumers | 3 minutes |
| [Network] | Bandwidth utilization | 60% of provisioned | 80% of provisioned | Upgrade bandwidth tier or add CDN | N/A (manual) |

### Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling Decision Criteria

| Factor | Horizontal (scale out) | Vertical (scale up) |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Application architecture | Stateless services, shared-nothing design | Stateful services, single-instance databases |
| Cost curve | Linear cost increase; cost-efficient at scale | Exponential cost increase at upper tiers |
| Failure impact | Loss of one instance is tolerable; others absorb load | Loss of the single instance is total failure |
| Scaling speed | Seconds to minutes (add instances to pool) | Minutes to hours (resize requires restart) |
| Upper bound | Limited by load balancer and coordination overhead | Limited by largest available instance type |
| Preferred for | Web servers, API gateways, workers, cache nodes | Databases (primary), in-memory stores, legacy applications |

### Load Projection Template

Use this table to project load growth and estimate when scaling actions will be needed.

| Month | Projected Users | Projected Requests/sec | Compute Needed | Storage Needed | Scaling Event Required |
|-------|----------------|----------------------|----------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Current | [N] | [N] | [N instances x size] | [N GB] | Baseline |
| +3 months | [N x growth] | [N x growth] | [estimate] | [estimate] | [Yes/No -- describe] |
| +6 months | [N x growth] | [N x growth] | [estimate] | [estimate] | [Yes/No -- describe] |
| +12 months | [N x growth] | [N x growth] | [estimate] | [estimate] | [Yes/No -- describe] |

**Cost estimation note:** For each scaling event row, include an estimated monthly cost delta so stakeholders can budget for infrastructure growth alongside feature development.
